What's this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cdcat is graphical (QT based) multiplatform (Linux/Windows/MacOS)
catalog program which scans the directories/drives you want and memorize the
filesystem including the tags of mp3's and other data and store it
in a small file.
The database is stored in a gzipped XML format, so you can hack it, or use
it if necessary :-)
And the program can store the content of some specified files up
to a limit size if you want. (for example: *.nfo)

Prerequisites:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Trolltech Qt  graphic library (ver >= 2.3.0)
       / http://www.trolltech.com /
- expat XML parsing library (ver >= 1.95.2)
      / http://expat.sourceforge.net /
- pcre Perl compatible regular expression library (ver >= 3.9)
     / ftp://ftp.csx.cam.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/ /
- zlib data compression library (ver >= 1.1.4)
    / http://www.zlib.org /

You can find this as packages in all distributions,
but if you want to compile the cdcat you will have to install the
devel packages too.

Compiling on Linux:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unpack the source, and check te prerequisites!
If it is done, check or set the QTDIR envronment variable
(It must point the root directory of Qt.)

$export QTDIR=/usr/local/qt/

go to the "src" directory.

    $cd src

Rebuild the makefile with

    $qmake cdcat.pro

then compile the program

    $make

/the qmake utility is part of the QT library/
If you got error messages try to check first the dependencies and the rights!
(before you send me bug report :-) )

That case you didn't get errors type: make install to copy the files
to the necessary place.

#make install

Compiling on MacOS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rebuid the cdcat Makefile with:  "qmake -macx cdcat.pro"
Then build the cdcat with:       "make"
