What's this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cdcat is graphical (QT based) multiplatform (Linux/Windows/MacOS)
catalog program which scans the directories/drives you want and memorize the
filesystem including the tags of mp3's and other data and store it
in a small file.
The database is stored in a gzipped XML format, so you can hack it, or use
it if necessary :-)
And the program can store the content of some specified files up
to a limit size if you want. (for example: *.nfo)

Prerequisites:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Nokia Qt graphic library (ver >= 4.x) / http://www.nokia.com
- zlib data compression library (ver >= 1.1.4) / http://www.zlib.org
- mediainfo / http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net
- libtar


You can find this as packages in all distributions,
but if you want to compile the cdcat you will have to install the
devel packages too.

Compiling on Linux:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Unpack the source, and check te prerequisites!
If it is done, check or set the QTDIR envronment variable
(It must point the root directory of Qt.)

$export QTDIR=/usr/local/qt/

go to the "src" directory.

    $cd src

Rebuild the makefile with

    $qmake cdcat.pro

then compile the program

    $make

/the qmake utility is part of the QT library/
If you got error messages try to check first the dependencies and the rights!
(before you send me bug report :-) )

That case you didn't get errors type: make install to copy the files
to the necessary place.

#make install

Compiling on MacOS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rebuid the cdcat Makefile with:  "qmake -macx cdcat.pro"
Then build the cdcat with:       "make"
