Hi!

If you would like to do the translation of your language follow these steps:

(the LC symbols alwais mean you language code, eg: EN,HU,DE... )

1)
  Download the latest source package, and copy the src/lang/start/cdcat_nolang.ts file
  to src/lang/cdcat_LC.ts
   
    $cp src/lang/start/cdcat_nolang.ts src/lang/cdcat_LC.ts
    
2)
  If your linux box contains the "linguist" QT program run go to 3. step.
  Install the "linguist" QT program. It should be in QT package.
  QT's homepage:  www.trolltech.com
 
3)
 Run the "linguist" under X  and open your cdcat_LC.ts file.

4)
 Do the translation.
 
/*** 
 Now the translation is done, if you don't like to use it immediately
 just send me the *.ts   But if you would like to use it in cdcat
 continue with the other steps
 ***/ 
 
5)
 Open the src/cdcat.pro and append your language file to the necessary place.
 You will find it next to the other translastions. (Find "cdcat_de.ts")
 
6)
 Run "lrelease cdcat.pro"  The lrelease program is part of the Qt.
 
7)
 Rebuild and reinstall the program
 
8)
 Send me your translation, so I can put it to the next release !!! 
 Send to: hyperr@freemail.hu


  That's it.
