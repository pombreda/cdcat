This document discibes how to import your gtktalog database into cdcat.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you can import it much easier as in history.
Simply create a report in gtktalog (DESELECT information and select xml as type, catalog.xml as filename).
now you can import the file:
open cdcat, select Import - import database
select your xml file
select xml as type
check 'new database' if you want (if empty there allways a new, but disabling is useful for merging databases)
click 'Import'
finish!

after a while (depends on your database) you will see you catalog in cdcat.
press the save toolbutton to save your cdcat catalog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to import a csv file to can use the older method:

First the lines have to be the following format:
<media>/<path>/.../<file><seperator><size><seperator><day/month/year><space><hour>:<minute>:<second>

First create a report on gtktalog:
Catalog - Create report:
select the following checkboxes (all others off):
-Disks
-Directories
-Files
-Sizes
-Dates

select Disk->Dir-File
enter * as Separator
Select output file, name ist as *.csv

now you can import the file:
open cdcat, select Import - import database
select your csv file
enter * as separator (replace the default ; )
check 'new database' if you want
check correct bad output style from gtktalog export
press 'Import'

after a while (depends on your database) you will see you catalog in cdcat.
press the save toolbutton to save your cdcat catalog.
